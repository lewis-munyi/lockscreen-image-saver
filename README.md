## Getting Started

Head over to the [download]() section to grab yourself a compiled version. If you're feeling nerdy follow the instructions below to learn how you can set up and compile the app yourself.

### Prerequisites

You will need these to run and set up the app

-   [Node.js]('https://nodejs.org) installed on your PC
-   [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app#installing-electron) installed globally on your PC

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repo from [this]("https://github.com/lewis-munyi/lockscreen-image-saver.git") url and extract it.

    ```
    cd lockscreen-image-saver/
    ```
3. List the contents of the directory.
    ```
    ls
    ```
4. You should have such a directory structure

    │   ├── js/
    │   ├── css/
    │   │── ...

    |── .gitignore
    |── firestore.rules

    |── index.js
    └── package.json
    ```

5. Install the required modules
